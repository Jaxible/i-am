<!--Welcome to "Projects Fuego..." Just follow along with comments like this one, and you'll design a really cool webtext that not only introduces you, your skills, and interests to the rest of the class, but also builds your coding literacy. Refer to the repository README for GitHub publishing help.-->

<!--BTW. You can leave these faded code comments be, or delete them. Programmers and web designers use these comments to better explain what the code is doing for others who may enter the document later. They are but road signs, absent from the larger design-->

<!--HTML pages start by calling <!DOCTYPE html> and designating a language.-->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <!--Next comes the <head> information including the title and all of the important links that make the webtext work. When a browser access your url, it looks first at the index.html document <head> to learn about the names and locations of the other files and assets it will need to assemble your code into a visual display.-->

  <!--Go ahead and fill in the blank in <title>I am...</title> (see just below). The <title> will appear in your document's browser tab-->
<title>I am Jake, or Jacob</title>
<!--The stuff below the title does important work to tell browsers what this page should look like on different screens-->
<meta charset="UTF-8">
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
<!--Next is a link to the cascading style sheet or CSS. Web designers use a cascading stylesheet CSS to add styling to a website. Designers do this by "calling" a <div class> in HTML and defining the class attributes on the style sheet. Doing so saves time and results in less code. On the style.css page you'll find attributes relating font, text size, image size, among other details.-->
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="style.css">
</head>


<body>
<!--Now we will start working in the body of the document. The body holds all of the code and content that will appear as a visual for our audience.-->

<!--Designers refer to this next section as a "Hero Image." The hero image is styled on the style.css page by calling a "class." To replace the hero image, simply place a .jpg file in the same file folder (directory) as this project and name it "hero.jpg." Alternatively, if you are working with a .png, you will need to open the style.css file using your text editor, find the "hero-image" class and change the file type from ".jpg" to ".png."" Browsers will only work with .jpg, .jpeg, or .png images. Since hero images need to stretch across the screen, typically you will want to select an image 1200px in width to allow quick load time yet avoid pixilation.-->


<div class="hero-image">
  <div class="hero-text">
      <h1>I am...</h1>
      <h2>Someone, I think</h2>
  </div>

<!--We'll use this first section to discuss where you are right now. Where do you go to school and what courses are you taking/enjoying. What majors/minors/certificates are you pursuing? Has this changed? Why? Replace the content between <h3> and </h3> that says "Lorem ipsum" etc -->


<!--Fuego programs sometimes use "in-line styling" to provide quick fixes to content design. In the above case, you could change "left" to "right" or "center" depending on your specific design needs. That said, left align is usually best practice for improving readability.-->

  <h2>Field of Study</h2>
  <h3>I am currently a junior Digital Narative and Interactive Design major, as well as working on a minor in Creative Writing. I transferred to Pitt from Rochester Institute of Technology in spring of 2022 after a gap year where I was working through discovering what I really want to do. I was orginally in a Game Design degree at RIT, but it was heavily coding-based, which wasn't a big issue but wasn't really what I wanted to do as a career. I feel that DNID is a good compromise between coding and technology as well as English-related courses, and the minor in Creative Writing helps me to accomplish my current desired career path.</h3>

<!--Replace the images here. You can also control max-image width%. Keep your file names simple, don't use spaces, and be case sensitive). Be sure to add alt="text." Visually impaired individuals using screen readers rely on alt="text" to describe pictures to them. Describe your image as clearly and succinctly as possible.-->

<!--What experience do you have to leverage in this class? Are you a writer, are you a maker, are you a thinker or critic? What is your medium/media? What interests you about that medium/those media? What media/skills do you wish to learn more about/pursue in this class?-->

<div class="textblock" style="text-align: left">
  <h2>Knowledge, Tools, and Skills</h2>
    <h3>I have some experince in object-oriented programming, in both C# and Java, which are pretty similar. I also have light knowledge of HTML/CSS already, so I already understand the basics of what is being done here. I've also used Adobe products before, in Composing Digital Media as well as other classes, where I've learned mostly Photoshop and a little Premiere to boot. I mostly consider myself both a writer and a thinker, but I'm still learning about how to effectively do both. I mostly operate in the medium of video games as well as standard writing in the realm of creative writing. I'm mostly interested in how video games operate due to the added feature of player interaction, and I enjoy seeing how player actions can influence a game's world, creating their own story in a way. I hope to learn a bit more about HTML, as I find it interesting despite my lack of heavy knowledge on how it operates. I would also enjoy being able to experiment more in general coding, as I feel it would help me to learn more about the medium, while also perhaps adding some of my own narrative flair in some way.</h3>

<!--Quick fact: Did you know "Lorem ipsum," the fill text used in this web template, was hacked out of Cicero's "De finibus bonorum et malorum"? Developers made it non-sensical, so don't bother with Google Translate.-->

<!--So, what exactly are you into? Take some time to explain your interest...what you will pursue in this class. What is it, define it, why is it important/significant, how do you intend to approach this subject matter?-->
<div class="textblock" style="text-align: left">
  <h2>Potential Project</h2>
      <h3>I haven't thought too much about what I want to do, so I'm not exactly sure what to put here. If I had to pick something, maybe an analysis on players of video games, why they play what they play, and how they go about doing that. I find that gamers have many different reasons for playing as much or as little as they do, so it'd be interesting to take a deeper dive into that and finding some cool way to present that.</h3>

<!--Let's talk a little about the future. After school what kind of job or career would you like to pursue? What is your reasoning for going on this path? How might it connect to all of these prior elements-field of study, home and family, interests and activities? How might the work we do in this space help you to realize this future?-->

<div class="textblock" style="text-align: left">
   <h2>In the Future</h2>
      <h3>In my future, I hope to become a story writer for some video game company, as I find that mode of narrative-building to be incredibly interesting. I figure that I may become a standard programmer and work my way up to become a narrative builder, but I'm not exactly sure if that's the path I want to commit to yet. Hopefully I will also branch out to other industries, such as TV or film. One day I even hope to write my own show if possible, but that will likely be far off if it even happens. I feel that my interest in video games as a medium will help me progress through the field, and that I develop more skills that will help me realize this future for myself, which I believe I can further in this class.</h3>
